v0.2 December 2014
 BREAKING CHANGES:
   * Origin is on the upper left corner of the image (was bottom left).
   * New simplified filters interface. The old interface is still used
     internally to create filters and is available in
     Vision.Image.Filter.Internal.
   * DevIL bindings (Vision.Image.Storage) are now in a separate package
     (friday-devil) and with an improved interface.
   * Benchmarks are now in a separate package (friday-bench).
   * Examples are now in a separate package (friday-examples).
   * Pixel instance is no more required for MaskedImage and Image instances.

 * SCW thresholding.
 * New types aliases for filters.
 * New (!) and (!?) operators for image and histogram indexing.
 * Classes and image types are in two different files (Vision.Image.Class and
   Vision.Image.Type).
 * NFData instance for Manifest images.

v0.1 August 2014
