v0.3        May 2014
 BREAKING CHANGES:
   * 'MaskedImage' instances are required to provide an implementation for the
     'lineConstant' and 'columnConstant' methods.
   * The 'FromFunction' class has been split in four classes ('FromFunction',
     'FromFunctionLine', 'FromFunctionCol' and 'FromFunctionLineCol').
     Line and column constants are now type parameters and constraints can be
     defined on them.
   * The 'fromFunctionCached' method as been renamed 'fromFunctionLineCol'.
   * The 'values' method from the 'MaskedImage' class has been moved to the
     new 'MaskedImageValues' class.
   * The 'vector' method from the 'Image' class has been moved to the new
     'ImageVector' class.
   * The 'InterpolMethod' type used with the 'resize' method no longer exist.
     Its three constructors ('TruncateInteger', 'NearestNeighbor' and
     'Bilinear') are now their own (phantom) types. This way, the resizing
     method is now resolved at compile time.

 * 'MaskedImage' instances are no more required to have pixels being an
   instance of 'Storable'.
 * 'Image' instances are no more required to provide an implementation for
   'index' nor 'linearIndex'.
 * Some SPECIALIZE pragmas were removed because of being responsible of long
   warning messages when compiled with GHC.
 * Improved performances.

v0.2.1.2    May 2015
 * Add test modules under `other-modules`.

v0.2.1.1    April 2015
 * Removes an orphan dependency to bytetring.
 * Fixes some warning when compiled with GHC 7.10.

v0.2.1.0    March 2015
 * Grey to HSV conversion.

v0.2.0.2    February 2015
 * Minor documentation improvements.

v0.2.0.1    January 2015
 * Setup.hs script.

v0.2        January 2015
 BREAKING CHANGES:
   * Origin is on the upper left corner of the image (was bottom left).
   * New simplified filters interface. The old interface is still used
     internally to create filters and is available in
     Vision.Image.Filter.Internal.
   * DevIL bindings (Vision.Image.Storage) are now in a separate package
     (friday-devil) and with an improved interface.
   * Benchmarks are now in a separate package (friday-bench).
   * Examples are now in a separate package (friday-examples).
   * Pixel instance is no more required for MaskedImage and Image instances.

 * SCW thresholding.
 * New types aliases for filters.
 * New (!) and (!?) operators for image and histogram indexing.
 * Classes and image types are in two different files (Vision.Image.Class and
   Vision.Image.Type).
 * NFData instance for Manifest images.

v0.1        August 2014
 * Initial release
